# VectorMathematics
A desktop application project in C# for performing basic vector mathematics

The solution consists of three projects namely

* Library: This is the business logic of the project which creates the vector objects and also
responsible for performing all the basic vector operations such as
• Inversion/negation of a vector
• Addition of two vectors
• Subtraction of two vectors
• Multiplication of a vector by a scalar
• Division of a vector by a scalar
• Scalar product of two vectors (inner product)
• Cross product of two vectors (vector product)
• Length of a vector
• Angle between two vectors
• Equality and inequality of two vectors

* Test: All the above mentioned vector operations have been tested in this project

* UI: A basic desktop application capable of taking two vectors and input from the user
and calculate the cross product of the two vectors and return the resultant vector components.

Note: The user may have to enable the library reference in Test and UI projects if it is not enabled. 
In addition to that the user has to set UI as the start up project to avoid any errors while running the solution.
